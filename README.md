# PocketNN
The Linux version of [PocketNN](https://github.com/jaewoosong/pocketnn): Integer-only Training and Inference of Neural Networks via Direct Feedback Alignment and Pocket Activations.
Improvements:
- The original [code](https://github.com/jaewoosong/pocketnn) was implemented in Windows environment, hence will produce some problems when executing in the linux environment.
- Add functions to save and load weights of neural network into `.csv` files after training so that we can load them to do inference later. The inference process only on the MNIST dataset is done in the `fc_int_dfa_mnist_inference()` function.
## Datasets
Two datasets used in this project are copied from their original website and are stored in `data/`
- MNIST dataset: MNIST dataset is from [the MNIST website](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)
- Fashion-MNIST dataset: Fashion-MNIST dataset is from [its github repository](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist).

## How to run
- `cmake -S . -B build`
- `cmake --build build`
- Run the compiled binary, for example `./build/MyPocketNN`

The result for running a simple 2-layer fully connected network on dummy data is like the following picture

The result for training a 3-layer fully connected network on MNIST is in the following picture

The result for inference only with pretrained weights of the 3-layer fully connected network on MNIST is in the following picture
